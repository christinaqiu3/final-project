## Milestone 1: Implementation part 1 (due 11/13)
We completed a barebones model in houdini, a basic greyscale shader with some screen glitching effects, and some other unreal functionality.

## Milestone 2: Implementation part 2 (due 11/25)
We completed a more detailed model with wires and bridges, some of the shaders, and cinematic camera movement in unreal.

## Final submission (due 12/2)
We completed a very detailed model with countless components, finished all the shaders (edge detection, hatching and paper), completed mouse follow blueprint for cinematic camera, added sound and fog.

## Post mortem
Our project took longer and was harder than expected due to complications with importing houdini assets into UE 5. We also ran into other bugs with the shaders that took some time to fix. We also planned to do multiple environments, but we only ended up doing one due to the time constraint. Overall, it still looks better than we thought it would by the end.
